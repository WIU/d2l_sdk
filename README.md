# Ruby Valence API
This project is a Ruby implementation of the Valence API. Utilizing the RESTful API that the Valence API offers, this Ruby implementation provides a useful means of implementing applications seamlessly.

## Installation
TODO: This project requires a multitude of gems...
I should probably denote these in the gemfile.

###### Anyways:

This project requires numerous gems, so simply install them via the gemfile and have all the files hierarchically the same in your directory, and they should work fine. If they do not, simply put in an issue with me and I will look into it ASAP.

## Usage
Complete the installation, require the 'd2l_api.rb' file in your ruby file, and use the many functions supported by the api to perform CRUD methods.
